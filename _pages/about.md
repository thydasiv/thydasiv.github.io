I'm Thyda Siv, a graduate student in Building Construction and Facility Management at Georgia Institute of Technology. I worked as an  an Architect at The Room Design Studio in Cambodia. The experience has equipped me with the technical and practical skills to manage complex architectural projects from conception to completion. I have supervised multiple architectural projects, including 4 residential projects, a brewery, an office and a data center. Through these experiences, I developed expertise in blueprint reading and as-built drawings, reviewing shop drawings and submittals, preparing RFIs, producing schemetic design, design development and construction drawings, creating material specification books, and understanding procedures in construction. My experience also includes coordinating with various stakeholders, resolving design conflicts, and ensuring adherence to specifications and quality standards. 

My passion for building comes from the excitement of witnessing my projects evolve from concept to reality. This motivation, combined with my experience collaborating with project managers during site visits and addressing unforeseen construction challenges, has helped me recognize that project management skills are essential for successfully bringing designs to life. This motivation led me to pursue advanced studies in construction management, where I'm developing expertise in cost estimation, scheduling, quality control, and construction safety.

I'm proficient in industry-standard tools including Procore, Bluebeam, MS Project, Revit, AutoCAD, and Microsoft Office Suite (Excel and Access). Additionally, I am also familiar with laser scanning, 360 imaging, BIM 4D (Asta Powerproject), and Digital Twin (CupixWorks). In addition to my technology expertise, I am passionate about sustainable building practices and hold a LEED Green Associate certification.

Currently seeking opportunities in construction project management to apply my unique blend of design creativity and technical knowledge to create value and drive project success.

When I am not working, I enjoy spending my time playing pingpong, badmiton, yoga, and reading.
